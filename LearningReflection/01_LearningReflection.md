> Please use the below questions as guidelines to help you think and plan your Learning Reflection Report

## 1. How was your experience testing the given Webapp?
- Quite interesting, I dare say, since it gave me the chance to really try and step into the shoes of a software tester and QA, casting a more critical eye on everything and thinking about the possible ways things might go wrong for the "average" user and replicating them in a "realistic" way. Very enlightening too, in the end! Undoubtedly I could have written a dozen more tests, but you can never test for every conceivable variable.
     

## 2. How did you write or manage your test case? Describe the process.
- Depending on the page being tasted at that moment, I either followed the given instructions or came up with my own test cases, which I followed along as I wrote them down, seeing if I saw anything unexpected and that I managed to writed down everything essential for the test, while avoiding unnecessary "rambling".
    

## 3. Do you recommend any other tools or styles for Test case management. 
 - Well, there are dozens and hundredrs of differents testing tools and platforms out there and what one uses depends on what is being tested. For example, if your intention is to test out JavaScript code/scripts, you might consider Jest. 
 - Regardless, what we've used here is adequate enough.


## 4. Which IDE (Visual Code or Atom or else) have you used to edit files?
- Visual Studio Code.


     
## 5. Did you find any trouble? how did you solve the trouble?
- I did not.


## 6. Did you find any trouble using Github? have you used Github before? where?
- I did not. I've used it for personal and school related programming projects.

      

## 7. If in the future if you need to automate these test cases, which framework or language will you use? and describe why (Robot Framework, Cypress, Selenium, or any other )
- I might consider Robot Framework, since I have used its Framework for Python and from what I've seen it is quite similar, meaning it might be somewhat easy and intuitive to pick up.



## 8. Kindly search the term `Tester` `Automation Tester` glassdoor and LinkedIn or any other job search website. Currently, list the skills and competencies that are most in-demand in software testing
- What is required of one depends on the context of one duties.
- For example, one spot in Sweden demands deep knowledge of Linux operating systems, strong programming skills in Python, experience with networks, DevOps skills and experience, along with "extensive" experience in software testing.
- Another one ask for at least years worth of experience in software development, automation, and testing, with proofs of previous automation projects, and expertise with the following technologies: Robot Framework, Docker, Kubernetes, Openshift, Jenkins, and Ansible. Besides those they also ask for excellent problem solving skills, propensive for logical and analytic thinking, and experience with writing test case documentation.
- A third one, while being extremely similar to the first example mentioned, places clear emphasis and importance on being capable of teamwork and group projects.




## 9. **Let's assume** that if you are going to continue with the career in Software Testing, which technical and soft skills do you need to fill up the blank in your resume?
- I'd definitely need to become more acquainted with the world of DevOps since it plays a rather large part in field of software testing. 
- Besides that I would certainly be required to enhance my understanding of various different technologies and programming languages and technologies, such as, but not limited to, Python and Docker. 
- Exploring and studying publicly available examples of professional software testing documentation might also be extremely valuable in adopting and picking up good practices. 




## 10. Write short Learning Reflection and  Free words Do you think that project helped in putting theoretical knowledge into practice? Describe? (is there anything else that you would like to share with us concerning the current study module). e.g. regarding the quality of content and your learning (or) improvement ideas? 
- Yes, I do believe the grounded nature of the project did help connect all the different theory modules and their topics together and create connections in my mind of how they might function in a real-life situation.
- The course was good and I am satisfied with its quality.
